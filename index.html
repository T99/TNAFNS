					In the spring of 2017, only 4 months after being sworn into office, Trump approved of his wife Melania’s abortion. After raising five other children <span onmouseover="onHover(this, 'Hmmm. We\'ll see. Controversial and over-the-top surprising news such as this should tip you off to start looking for more clues. It doesn\'t always guarantee that the article is fake, but watch out!')" onmouseout="onUnHover(this)">Trump and Melania agreed to have a secret abortion</span> in an abortion clinic called Early Options in downtown New York to protect his new and fragile presidency. This is the exact opposite of what Trump campaigned for, and flies in the face of his supposed 'values'!
				</p>
				
				<p class="articletext">
					On April 12, 2017 the abortion was done by a Hispanic doctor named, Dr. Leike Buhm <span onmouseover="onHover(this, 'This person worked as a physician at an abortion clinic AND worked at CNN? Seems unlikely -- especially when a Google search of their name returns no relevant results!')" onmouseout="onUnHover(this)">who also worked part time at a CNN news outlet</span>. After performing the procedure President Trump had Dr. Buhm deported for illegally immigrating to America which cause Dr. Buhm to inform the press of the private procedure. Within 2 days of performing the abortion, Buhm had been deported -- <span onmouseover="onHover(this, 'The hard-to-believe facts are starting to pile up! There also hasn\'t been any hard-proof or citable sources as of yet. We should be more than suspicious at this point!')" onmouseout="onUnHover(this)">going from a U.S. citizen to a deportee less than 48 hours from a time in which Buhm had no idea that they would be leaving the country.</span> No warning whatsoever!

					<span onmouseover="onHover(this, 'They cite a source, but not in the context of the article, that is to say that this quote has simply been repurposed. Be careful of falling for this trick, not just any quote makes an article credible!')" onmouseout="onUnHover(this)">According to the Business Insider, “Trump has expressed a strong opposition to abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, and when the mother's health is endangered.”</span> But in this situation none of these exceptions applied, and Melania still recieved the abortion. What were they thinking? This is outrageous in the context of Trump's campaign. Conservative values seem to have been thrown out the window, gone!

If this was real, it would most likely be accredited to an author, or at the very least not have a black bar!')" onmouseout="onUnHover(this)">
				
				<p class="articletext">
					Investigators are still finding evidence pointing Trump having agreed to the abortion. <span onmouseover="onHover(this, '\'Eyewitness account?\' Who?? Unnamed sources and other unaccreddited information should be scrupulously checked -- vague and unknown informants aren\'t trustworthy sources if they even exist!')" onmouseout="onUnHover(this)">An eyewitness account stated that they had seen Trumps wife entering the clinic wearing a trench coat, sunglasses, and a large hat.</span> Also while looking back at previous records between 2:00 to 7:00 P.M. on April 12, no one exactly knows where Melania Trump was during this time. President Trump refuses to answer any questions of Melania's whereabouts that day. All members of the Trump family refused to comment, but one of our insiders at the <span onmouseover="onHover(this, 'Real news publications do a careful job checking and editing their articles before publication, and therefore almost never contain simple grammatical or spelling error such as this!')" onmouseout="onUnHover(this)">WhietHuose said that Trump left to take Melania somwewhere</span> that day! Wow!
